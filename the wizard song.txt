[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
(The beginning) Taking you back to day one
The light was the blinding bright of two suns
(Come down) Touch the ground we hang from
The rest can look back when yesterday comes
(Once again) I return to the same mistake
And the pleasure that I hate and the pain it makes
(Turn around) Take a look back to see
The darkness in a figure in the shape of me
It's not an illusion, not seeing double
My mistakes from the past are today's new trouble
What I knew got lost in the shuffle
And I can’t go digging in yesterday's rubble
So I’m left with a taste in my mouth
That I hate but I can’t seem to scrape it out
So when I say that I pray it'll go away
I’m reminded of this thing that you left in me

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Down on the fairy tale path
There is a wizard awaiting you
With aluminum fashion
And with panthers to boot

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Send me your power
Through the lightning in your eyes
Wearing the magic hat
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
(The beginning)
Bringing the thought back again
Your face with rain dripping down off your chin
(Come down)
Hold the ground we cling to
The rest can look back when yesterday’s through
(Once again)
Encore of the same mistake
And the pleasure that I hate and the pain it makes
(Turn around)
Take a look back to see
The darkness in a figure in the shape of me
It's not an illusion, not seeing double
Your mistakes from the past are today's new trouble
What you knew got lost in the shuffle
And you can’t go digging in yesterday's rubble
So I’m left with a taste in my mouth
That I hate but I can’t seem to scrape it out
So when I say that I pray it'll go away
I’m reminded of this thing that you left in me

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Down on the fairy tale path
There is a wizard awaiting you
With aluminum fashion
And with panthers to boot

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Send me your power
Through the lightning in your eyes
Wearing the magic hat
Yeah, yeah, yeah
